<p>The Bucks fan base has long waited to be excited for something but with Giannis, Khris, and Jrue all on the floor it's hard not be excited. Giannis was drafted in 2013 as the 15th pick in the first round. No one really knew who he ws or if he had any potential at all but those are things of the past. As he now is a <b> two time MVP, Finals MVP, Defensive Player of The Year, 6-time NBA All Star, 3-time NBA first team, 75th Anniversary team highlights the best player ever to play and averaging some of the best number in history this season with 29.7ppg 6apg 11.5rpg. </b> Khris Middleton was also picked up via trade in 2013 and has since put up promising numbers averaging <b>20ppg 5apg 5rpg while also being a three time NBA All-Star</b>. Jrue Holiday was picked up via trade in 2020 and instantly made a huge impact being one of the best all around players at his position. The trio is arguably the best in NBA. </p>
